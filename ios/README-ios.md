# OpenGothic on iOS — build & install guide

Play OpenGothic (Gothic II: Night of the Raven) on iPhone/iPad with a Bluetooth
controller. Two routes are documented: **no Mac** (recommended for you) and
**with a Mac**.

> You must legally own Gothic II: NotR. The game ships **no** assets; you supply
> them from your own installation.

---

## Route A — No Mac, no build (download + sideload)

### 1. Get the unsigned .ipa
You do **not** need to fork or build anything. Two ways, easiest first:

- **SideStore source (recommended — one tap + auto-updates):** in SideStore →
  **Sources → +**, paste
  `https://github.com/tryk016/opengothic-ios/releases/download/latest/apps.json`,
  then install **OpenGothic** from that source. New builds appear as updates.
- **Direct download:** open the
  **[Releases page](https://github.com/tryk016/opengothic-ios/releases/latest)** and
  download the `OpenGothic-unsigned.ipa` asset.

> Maintainers only: the workflow `.github/workflows/ios.yml` (macos runner,
> `cmake`+`glslang`, `iphoneos` arm64, signing disabled) builds the `.ipa` and
> **publishes it to the `latest` Release automatically** on every push, plus
> uploads it as an artifact. Trigger via push or Actions → "iOS build" → Run
> workflow. Regular users never need this.

### 2. Sign & install with your own free Apple ID
- **SideStore (recommended, refreshes on-device over Wi‑Fi):** after adding the
  source above, tap install. SideStore re-signs with your free Apple ID **and
  auto-refreshes the 7-day certificate itself over any Wi‑Fi — no PC needed**
  after the one-time pairing setup. See https://sidestore.io.
- **AltStore / Sideloadly (alternative):** install **AltServer for Windows**
  (needs iTunes + iCloud from Apple's site — **not** the Microsoft Store
  versions) and **AltStore** on the iPhone; sign in with a **free Apple ID**;
  choose **Install .ipa** → `OpenGothic-unsigned.ipa`. AltServer re-signs and
  installs over USB/Wi‑Fi, but auto-refresh needs the PC running on the same
  Wi‑Fi. See https://altstore.io.
- On the phone: Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → **trust** your
  developer certificate.
- The free cert **expires after 7 days**; SideStore/AltStore auto-refresh it.
  Free accounts allow **3 sideloaded apps** at a time.

### 3. Copy game data (from Windows)
The app enables File Sharing (`Info.plist`: `UIFileSharingEnabled`,
`LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`). Copy the **contents** of your Gothic II
folder into the app's Documents:
- Source: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Gothic II`
- Copy the `Data/`, `_work/`, and `system/` folders in.
- Options: **iTunes for Windows** → device → File Sharing → OpenGothic → Add;
  or the **Files** app on the device (e.g. from a USB drive / iCloud Drive).

The game auto-detects data in Documents (`commandline.cpp`) and validates
`Data`, `_work/Data`, and compiled scripts. If data is missing you get an
on-screen alert instead of a crash.

---

## Route B — With a Mac (Xcode, free Apple ID)

1. `brew install cmake glslang`; install Xcode + `xcode-select --install`.
2. `./ios/build-ios.sh` then `open build-ios/Gothic2Notr.xcodeproj`.
3. Xcode → Settings → Accounts → add your **free** Apple ID (a "Personal Team"
   appears). Target → Signing & Capabilities → **Automatically manage signing**,
   pick the personal team, set a unique bundle id if needed.
4. If signing fails on `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit`,
   remove that key from `Info.plist.in` (see below) and rebuild.
5. Run on the device; trust the certificate as in Route A. Copy game data via
   Finder → device → Files. Same 7-day expiry (rebuild weekly, or use AltStore).

## Recommended settings (do this first)

The hard 30 fps cap is gone — the iOS build now unlocks ProMotion / high refresh.
Device-confirmed: ~60 fps in menus and ~40–45 fps in-game on recent hardware
(was a hard 30). The engine still defaults to full native resolution with SSAO
on, which drags the 3D scene down and heats the phone. Set the two options below
once after the first launch; the change applies live, no restart needed:

**Path A — in-game menu (no file editing):**
1. Options → Video → *resolution*: **upscale(half)** (safe everywhere) or
   **upscale(75%)** (newer devices, e.g. A17 Pro / A18).
2. Options → Video → untick **Cloud shadows** — in OpenGothic this switch is
   actually SSAO; disabling it is the single biggest fps win.

Only the 3D scene is rendered at the reduced resolution and upscaled (Lanczos);
HUD, menus and subtitles always stay sharp at native resolution.

**Path B — the same via config files:** in `Documents/Gothic.ini` set
`vidResIndex` and `zCloudShadowScale` as shown in the config reference below.

**Optional frame cap** — the build runs uncapped by default (recommended, so
ProMotion can do its job). Add a cap only if you want steadier pacing or less
heat / battery drain on long sessions, and keep it at your display's refresh —
capping below in-game fps just undoes the ProMotion unlock. Create
`Documents/system/SystemPack.ini` (if it does not exist):

```ini
[PARAMETERS]
FPS_Limit=60       ; 0 = uncapped (default). Don't set below ~45 or you undo ProMotion.
```

## Controls (Gothic Classic scheme)

| Function | Xbox | PS5 |
|---|---|---|
| Primary interact / attack | A | ✕ |
| Secondary / draw weapon | Y | △ |
| Jump / climb / swim up | B | ○ |
| Crouch / dive / sneak | X | □ |
| Move (proportional left/right turn) | Left stick | Left stick |
| Look | Right stick | Right stick |
| Magic quick-ring (runes, scrolls) | RB | R1 |
| Item quick-ring (potions, food) | LT | L2 |
| Toggle sprint | L3 | L3 |
| Lock-on target | R3 | R3 |
| Block / parry | RT | R2 |
| Draw melee weapon / bow | D-pad ▲ / ▼ | D-pad ▲ / ▼ |
| Quick slots (player-assignable) | D-pad ◀ / ▶ | D-pad ◀ / ▶ |
| Switch locked target | flick Right stick ◀/▶ | flick Right stick ◀/▶ |
| Inventory | View | Touchpad |
| Pause menu | Menu | Options |
| Quick save | LB + Menu | L1 + Options |
| Quick load | LB + View | L1 + Touchpad |
| Warp to nearest waypoint (unstuck) | hold L3 + R3 ~2 s | hold L3 + R3 ~2 s |

Notes on feel and on-screen input:
- **Quick-rings** are *hold-to-aim*: hold the ring button, steer the highlight
  with the right stick, release to equip magic / use an item. Contents are
  pulled live from your inventory and shown as **real 3D item icons**.
- **Target lock-on** (R3) pins the current focus via the engine's native focus
  (not a camera hack); it auto-releases when the target dies or leaves. While
  locked, a hard horizontal **flick of the right stick** steps to the next /
  previous target.
- **Quick slots** (D-pad ◀ / ▶) fire any item you bind to them — potion, food,
  rune, scroll, torch. To bind: open the inventory, highlight the item and
  **hold D-pad ◀ or ▶ for ~0.6 s** (a short press still navigates). Slots
  persist in `Gothic.ini`; unassigned slots drink the best healing (◀) / mana
  (▶) potion. A slot bound to the torch toggles it: first press lights the
  torch, second press stows it back into the inventory (bind the torch while
  one is still in the inventory — a lit torch has no row to highlight).
- **Left-stick response:** forward/back keeps Gothic's animation-driven motion
  but uses separate press/release thresholds; horizontal turning is scaled by
  the stick deflection. Rings, UI transitions, controller resets and app resume
  release held world actions and require a return to neutral before re-arming.
- **On-screen virtual gamepad:** with no controller, a full pad is drawn during
  play (buttons, sticks, D-pad, move + camera area). Tap a ring button, drag to
  aim, release to activate. It **auto-hides the moment a controller connects**.
- **Controls-help hint bar** flashes context-sensitive button prompts, and a
  **lock-on reticle** brackets the pinned target (gamepad only).
- **Controller-layout screen:** Options → Controls shows a full pad diagram
  (Xelu line-art) with leader lines, button glyphs and localized labels
  (EN/DE/PL) for the whole mapping — instead of the keyboard bindings list,
  which is dead weight without a keyboard. B/Escape (or the touch Back button)
  returns to Options.
- **Haptics** fire on taking damage, on lock-on / ring-commit, and on quick-save.
- **HUD is safe-area aware** — HP/mana/swim bars, world clock, fps counter and
  the hint bar avoid the notch / Dynamic Island and the rounded corners; the 3D
  scene stays full-bleed.

## Config reference (Documents/Gothic.ini)

`Documents/Gothic.ini` is created by the app on first run. Its values override
the `system/Gothic.ini` you copied from the PC, so this is the right place for
device-specific tweaks. Add only the entries you want to change:

```ini
[GAME]
showFpsCounter=1        ; on-screen FPS counter (mobile)
language=2              ; force Polish if you have Polish data
useQuickSaveKeys=1      ; enable quick save/load (may default off)

[INTERNAL]
vidResIndex=2           ; 3D render scale: 0=full, 1=upscale(75%), 2=upscale(half)

[ENGINE]
zCloudShadowScale=0     ; 0 = SSAO off ("Cloud shadows" in the video menu)
shadowResolution=512    ; shadow-map size (iOS default 512; PC default 2048;
                        ; raise to 1024/2048 for crisper shadow edges)

[GAMEPAD]
deadZone=0.25           ; axis press threshold (0..1)
releaseZone=0.15        ; release threshold; must stay below deadZone
crossAxisGuard=0.12     ; raises the perpendicular threshold near cardinal directions; 0 disables it
triggerThreshold=0.50   ; how far RT/R2 must be pressed to register (0..1)
lookSensitivity=0.20    ; right-stick look speed
invertY=0               ; 1 = invert vertical look
saveSlots=5             ; rotating quick-save slot count
;noStuckProtect=1       ; disable the L3+R3 unstuck warp
;padQuickSlot=<n>       ; managed automatically (rotating save index)
;quickSlotL=<cls>       ; managed automatically (D-pad ◀ assignment)
;quickSlotR=<cls>       ; managed automatically (D-pad ▶ assignment)
;debugInput=1           ; transition-only controller trace in stderr.log
```

A connected controller works out of the box — the uncommented `[GAMEPAD]`
values above are the built-in defaults; commented entries are optional. Add a
  line only when you want a different value. Keep `0 < releaseZone < deadZone < 1`;
  the lower release threshold is the hysteresis that prevents noise near the
  press threshold from repeatedly latching movement. `crossAxisGuard` rejects
  the small perpendicular component produced by imperfect cardinal stick motion.

## Known limitations / follow-ups
- **Save-slot thumbnails** are not captured on iOS yet — slots show name, date
  and in-game time, but the preview picture is blank (the GPU screenshot readback
  aborted in the Metal driver, so a placeholder is saved instead).
- **Mesh shaders** are defaulted **off** on iOS for GPU compatibility; modern
  Apple GPUs (A17 Pro / M-series) could re-enable them.
- **No TestFlight / App Store** — requires a paid Apple Developer account and
  App Review (which would reject an engine reimplementation + copyrighted data).
  Sideloading for personal use avoids review entirely.
- `increased-memory-limit` entitlement may be stripped under free signing; large
  worlds rely on the device's default per-app limit (fine on modern devices).

> Quick save/load and native target lock-on were previously listed here as
> unfinished. Both are now implemented and **device-confirmed** — quick save/load
> (incl. the earlier save crash-to-home) works from menus and gamepad, and lock-on
> uses the engine's native focus. See [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) for the full status.

## Disabling the increased-memory-limit entitlement
If free signing rejects it, delete these two lines from `Info.plist.in`:
```xml
  <key>com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit</key>
  <true/>
```
