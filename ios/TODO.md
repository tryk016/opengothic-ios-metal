# iOS port — status & backlog

Tracked work beyond the core "build + run + control" milestone.
Bug ids (B1–B9, N1–N5) refer to the code-review report; phases refer to the
"ideal gamepad" control spec.

## ✅ Done — device-test round 1 fixes (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Save crash** — `MainWindow::saveGame` captured a GPU thumbnail
      (`screenshoot`+`submit`+`readPixels`) which aborts in the Metal driver on
      iOS. On iOS: skip that path, save a small placeholder preview + empty
      background; also guard the saving screen against an empty banner texture.
- [x] **Skip cutscenes** — output-only cutscene lines (`state==Idle`,
      `current.time>0`) ignored all input; `DialogMenu::keyDownEvent` now lets
      Esc/Return (touch Skip, pad B) call `skipPhrase` there too.
- [x] **Keep screen awake** — `application.idleTimerDisabled = YES` in
      `applicationDidBecomeActive` (via `apply-patches.sh`); the display no
      longer dims/locks mid-game when using a gamepad.
- [x] **Game Mode** — `GCSupportsGameMode` + `LSApplicationCategoryType =
      public.app-category.games` in `Info.plist` (lets iOS 18+ treat it as a game).
- [x] **FPS counter** — the existing overlay (drawn on mobile) is now toggled by
      `Gothic.ini [GAME] showFpsCounter=1` (read in `setupSettings`). NOTE: a
      literal checkbox inside the in-game options menu needs MENU.DAT (game-data)
      editing — not doable from engine code; the ini flag is the practical toggle.

## ✅ Done — critical bugfix cluster (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Dialogue voice-over** — root cause was iOS unconditionally skipping
      `Speech*.vdf` (OOM guard for iPhone 7). Now mounted on ≥4 GB devices,
      skipped only on <4 GB. ZenKit mmaps archives → low resident cost.
      (`resources.cpp`)
- [x] **B7** — split fatal exception handling: `GothicNotFoundException` shows the
      "data not found" alert + keeps a run-loop (safe, pre-window); any other
      exception logs + exits without spinning a second `Application` over a
      half-torn-down window. (`main.cpp`)
- [x] **B1** — Escape / Inventory now live on pad **and** touch: window-level
      `MainWindow::uiAction()` (shared with the keyboard path), called instead of
      the no-op `PlayerControl::onKeyPressed`. (`mainwindow.*`, `touchinput.cpp`)
- [x] **B2** — context-aware pad dispatcher (`PadCtx` + `padContext()` +
      `dispatchKey()`): pad drives menus / dialogue / inventory via synthetic
      key events, not just gameplay. (`gamepadinput.*`, `mainwindow.*`)
- [x] **B3** — gamepad quick save/load wired to `Gothic::quickSave/quickLoad`
      with the F5/F9 guards (LB+Menu / LB+View). (`gamepadinput.cpp`)
- [x] **B5** — pad disconnect mid-hold releases all world actions (no stuck keys).
- [x] **B6** — camera Y sign unified with the touch overlay; `invertY` field added.
- [x] Touch navigation for **inventory** — resolved by the same dispatcher.

## ✅ Done — iOS lifecycle & audio hardening (2026-07-10)
- [x] **B4** — `touchesCancelled` handled in Tempest `iosapi.mm` (forwards to
      `touchesEnded`); fixes stuck movement + leaked touch id on system touch
      cancel. Applied via `ios/patches/apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **B8** — `AVAudioSession` (Playback category, activated before any
      SoundDevice); linked `-framework AVFoundation`.
      (`game/utils/audiosession.{h,mm,cpp}`, `main.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`)
- [x] **N2** — `implDestroyWindow` invalidates `displayLink` + nulls `owner`
      (pairs with B7). Applied via `apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **N3** — fiber stack 1 MB → 8 MB (deep VM/vob recursion headroom).
      Applied via `apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **N5** — `Info.plist.in`: `UIRequiresFullScreen`, `ITSAppUsesNonExempt-
      Encryption=false`, `GCSupportsControllerUserInteraction`,
      `UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents`.

## ✅ Done — input coverage + landscape (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Touch dialogue controls** — the overlay is now context-aware
      (`MainWindow::padContext`): in dialogue it shows Up/Down (pick choice),
      Select (K_Return) and **Skip** (K_ESCAPE → `skipPhrase`), so lines can be
      skipped and choices confirmed from touch. (Pad already did this via B2.)
- [x] **Touch menu value editing** — menu/inventory overlay gained a full D-pad
      incl. **◀ ▶** (K_Left/K_Right), so sliders/options can be changed, plus
      OK/Back. Routed through `dispatchKey` to the active widget.
- [x] **Landscape orientation lock** — `Info.plist` landscape-only (iPhone+iPad)
      and both `supportedInterfaceOrientations` in `iosapi.mm` restricted to
      `MaskLandscape` (via `apply-patches.sh`); still rotates Left/Right.

## 🔥 In progress — save crash-to-home (round 3)
- Round 1 (`c0f30e50`, `d4de87ec`): removed GPU-thumbnail readback + fixed the
  `applicationSupportDirectory` MRC over-release. Save persists, crash remained.
- Round 2 (`56684300`): `catch(std::exception)` guards in `render()` +
  `implProcessEvents`. Crash remained, **no guard logged** → not a std::exception.
- Round 3 (`189145ae` + this): `catch(...)` guards + **exception identity
  logging** (`utils/exceptiondump.{h,mm,cpp}` — rethrows and names NSExceptions
  incl. throw-site backtrace); the loader-thread `noexcept` lambda now also has
  `catch(...)` (a foreign exception there aborted with no log at all);
  `implProcessEvents` guard additionally catches `NSException*` with
  name/reason; `terminateHandler` writes the NSException identity to crash.log.
- **Round 3 RESULT (device log, 2026-07-10): exception hypothesis REFUTED.**
  crash.log tag is `SIGABRT` (signal handler), not `std::terminate` → no
  exception ever unwound; none of the four guards logged. Disassembly of the
  shipped binary: `implProcessEvents+368` is the **return address of the final
  `swapContext()` call** (+48=objc_autoreleasePoolPush, +360=objc_autoreleasePoolPop,
  +364=bl swapContext) → the game fiber finished its dispatch cleanly (pool
  popped) and the abort happens **inside libobjc on the UIKit/apple-fiber side**;
  the frames below libobjc are stale fiber-stack remnants (manual setjmp/longjmp
  breaks the FP walk).
- Round 4 (this): recover the **real abort reason** — `CrashLog::dumpStack` now
  dumps every image's `__DATA,__crash_info` annotations (what Apple shows as
  "Application Specific Information", e.g. libobjc's `_objc_fatal` message);
  `[save]` breadcrumbs (Log::e → flushed) at save begin / worker done /
  finalize begin / finalize done narrow the crash window; stderr redirected to
  `Documents/stderr.log` (libc++abi/libobjc last words). Also ask the user for
  the `.ips` from Settings → Privacy → Analytics Data, and whether quick-LOAD
  (LB+View) crashes the same way (would implicate the shared
  finalize/onWorldLoaded path).

## ⏳ To do — deferred (needs on-device iteration)
- [ ] **B9 / N1** — pause game tick (`onTimer`) + `displayLink` while
      backgrounded. Deferred: the manual setjmp/longjmp fiber loop in `implExec`
      means naively sleeping the main context starves the UIKit run loop; needs
      careful on-device testing. (Render is already gated on `isApplicationActive`.)

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, phase 3 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Target-lock via native focus** (spec §3) — R3 pins the current npc focus
      (`PlayerControl::toggleTargetLock`); `tickFocus` keeps it instead of
      re-finding by aim, and auto-releases when the target dies/leaves
      (`World::validateFocus` + `Npc::isDead`). D-pad ←/→ switch target
      (`focusLeft/focusRight` → `moveFocus`). Existing focus highlight shows it.
      Replaces the provisional R3→`LookBack`.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 1 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **[GAMEPAD] config** (spec §8) — `deadZone`, `triggerThreshold`,
      `lookSensitivity`, `invertY`, `saveSlots` read from `Gothic.ini [GAMEPAD]`
      in `GamepadInput::loadConfig`. Replaces the hard-coded tunables.
- [x] **Rotating quick-saves** (spec §6) — LB+Menu saves to `save_slot_1..N`
      (N=`saveSlots`), auto-named `Quick - <world>`; index persisted in
      `[GAMEPAD] padQuickSlot`. LB+View loads the last rotating slot.
- [x] **Controls-help overlay** (spec §5) — context-sensitive button hints,
      flashed for ~4 s on context change, gamepad-only. Text glyphs (no bundled
      assets). Target **lock-on reticle** (corner brackets) drawn on the pinned
      target. Touch overlay auto-hides when a gamepad is connected.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 2 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Radial rings** (spec §4) — RB opens the weapon quick-bar, LT the item
      quick-bar; hold to aim with the right stick, release to activate
      (`Npc::useItem` equips weapons / consumes items). Content pulled live from
      inventory (weapons = NF|FF, items = POTION|FOOD), own vector segments with
      text labels + equipped/selection markers. `QuickRing` owned by
      `GamepadInput`, drawn by `MainWindow`.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 3 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Haptics** (spec §7) — `Haptics::impact` via `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`
      (haptics.mm/.cpp split like systemmsg). Heavy pulse when the player's HP
      drops (polled, no combat-code changes); light on lock/ring-commit; medium
      on quick-save.
- [x] **Stuck-protection** (spec §8) — hold L3+R3 ~2 s to warp to the nearest
      waypoint (`World::findWayPoint` + `Npc::setPosition`); opt out with
      `[GAMEPAD] noStuckProtect=1`.

## ✅ Done — controller glyphs (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Xelu CC0 glyphs** (Xbox Series set) bundled in `assets/controller/`,
      loaded from the app bundle (`padglyphtex.mm`, `Resources::loadTexturePm`)
      and drawn as real button art; falls back to the drawn glyphs
      (`padglyph.cpp`: A/B/X/Y discs, LB/RB/LT/RT pills, sticks, D-pad, Menu/View)
      if a texture is missing. Used by the touch overlay + controls-help bar.

## ✅ Done — full on-screen virtual gamepad (2026-07-10)
- [x] World touch overlay is now a **full virtual pad** (16 glyph buttons):
      A/B/X/Y, RB(weapon ring)/RT(block)/LB(quick-save)/LT(item ring), L3(walk)/
      R3(lock), D-pad (Heal/Potion + focus L/R), View/Menu, plus move pad + camera.
      Each wired to its action via `ctrl`/`uiAction`/new `MainWindow::pad*`
      bridges. **Touch ring-selection**: tapping RB/LT opens the radial, drag aims
      it, release activates (`GamepadInput::ring*` hooks). Uses Xelu glyphs.
      NOTE: button placement/sizes are v1 — tune on device.

## ⏳ Spec gaps / simplifications (control spec §1–§8) — deliberate, not blocking
- [ ] Rings are **single-ring v1**: no concentric multi-ring + centre-easing
      (`SmoothIncrease`), no world-pause while open, no pulsing highlight, text
      labels instead of 3D item icons (spec §4.3–§4.5).
- [ ] Target-lock has no **camera auto-pull** toward the pinned target (spec §3).
- [ ] No dedicated **Dead**-screen / **Container**-vs-Inventory / **MapDoc**
      pad contexts (folded into Menu/Inventory) (spec §1.1).
- [ ] Inventory RB/LB **tab switching** + right-stick 3D item preview (spec §2.4).
- [ ] Overlay **daylight tint** (spec §5.5, optional).
- [ ] Deferred B9/N1 background pause (needs on-device fiber testing).

Otherwise §1–§8 implemented; remaining is polish / on-device tuning (ring feel,
haptic intensity, glyph sizing, hint wording).

## ✅ Done — UI / readability
- [x] Scale up UI on iOS for high-DPI legibility (`MainWindow::uiScale`).
- [x] Dialogue subtitle window enlarged / reflowed for phone screens.
- [x] Dialogue **choice** list enlarged and made touch-friendly.
- [x] Main-menu text size verified after the uiScale change.

## ⏳ To do — Language
- [ ] Polish requires Polish game data (e.g. GOG Gold Edition or a PL install);
      then automatic, or force via `[GAME] language=2` in Documents/Gothic.ini.
