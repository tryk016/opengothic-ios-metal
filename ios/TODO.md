# iOS port — status & backlog

## ⏳ Backlog — next round (updated 2026-07-12, device round 4 pending)
- [ ] **Torch stow — IMPLEMENTED, device confirmation pending.** Root cause:
      lighting consumed the `ItLsTorch` item (`Inventory::use` ITM_TORCH
      branch), the lit torch is only a hand visual, and the stow branch never
      refunded the item — with the last torch lit there was no path back at
      all (no inventory row, quick slot bailed on "not in inventory"). Fix:
      (1) stowing refunds one `ItLsTorch` (light+stow is now lossless);
      (2) `Inventory::use` stows the hand torch even at count 0 when called
      with the torch cls; (3) the D-pad/touch quick slot falls through to that
      path when the item is missing but a torch is lit. Verify on device:
      bind torch to a slot, light → stow → light again; also stow via
      inventory when a spare torch remains. (`processDefInvTorch`/`invTorch`
      turned out to be only the temporary mobsi hide/restore, not a stow.)
- [ ] **Post-jump hover — IMPLEMENTED, device confirmation pending.** After a
      jump the character hung ~30 cm in the air for 0.2–0.5 s. Cause (upstream
      bug, code identical to upstream): during `Jump` the engine trusts anim
      root motion with no ground attach, and the `Jump→InAir` handoff starts
      the fall from the whole-anim *average* velocity ≈ 0 — a 30 cm free fall
      from rest takes ~0.25 s (g=0.00098 cm/ms²). Fix: when the jump anim
      ends, snap to the ground if it is within `stepHeight()` (50 cm, the same
      tolerance grounded movement uses); deep water excluded so jumps into
      water still splash. A temporary `[jump] end: dY=…` log (movealgo.cpp)
      confirms on-device; remove after one clean round. If hover persists,
      the log will show `fall` + the case is the climb/jump-up path instead
      (tickClimb end / tickJumpup — see recon notes in the session).
- [ ] **External-controller movement fix — device confirmation pending**
      (`6a5db6a8` + `df4d7f7e`, user-authored event-queue input model; CI
      green in run `29196747359`). Verify on hardware: 20 short X/Y flicks,
      ring/context transitions, disconnect + background/resume.
- [ ] **shadowResolution=512** — new iOS default; verify fps + visual cost.
- [ ] **Remove the `[jump]` diagnostic log** (movealgo.cpp Jump branch) after
      one clean confirmation round. (`[mobsi]` logs removed 2026-07-12.)
- [ ] **Upstream PRs** (device-confirmed in this fork): `Interactive::attach`
      root-vs-feet fix; `MenuRoot::setMenu` + onTick; `fixNpcPosition`
      rejecting spots on top of interactive colliders; once device-confirmed,
      add the jump-end ground attach and the torch stow refund (both are
      upstream bugs too — the second silently destroys a torch per
      light+stow cycle on all platforms).

## ✅ Done — Remake-style D-pad, magic ring, shadows (2026-07-12, round 2)
> **DEVICE-CONFIRMED (round 3):** mobsi levitation gone (player + NPCs), the
> magic quick-ring works, D-pad quick-slot binding works. Shadows at 1024
> showed no measurable fps change (still 35–45); trying 512 next.
- [x] **D-pad, Gothic-Remake style** — ▲ draws melee (`WeaponMele`), ▼ bow/
      crossbow (`WeaponBow`), ◀/▶ are **player-assignable quick slots**: hold
      ◀/▶ ~0.6 s on a highlighted inventory item to bind (short press still
      navigates); persisted as `[GAMEPAD] quickSlotL/R` (item cls id);
      unassigned slots keep the classic best-heal / best-mana behavior.
      Touch overlay mirrors all of it (binding is pad-only for now).
- [x] **RB = magic quick-ring** (runes + scrolls, `ITM_CAT_RUNE`); the LT item
      ring is back to potions/food only. The old weapon ring is gone — ▲/▼
      cover weapon draw; picking a specific weapon happens in the inventory.
- [x] **Target switch = right-stick flick** while locked (>0.75 deflection,
      350 ms cooldown) — frees the D-pad for the slots.
- [x] **shadowResolution** — no longer hard-coded 2048: `[ENGINE]
      shadowResolution` in Gothic.ini, default **512 on iOS** (1024 showed no
      measurable device gain; 512 visual verification is still queued).
      Rebuilds live via setupSettings.
- [x] **Mobsi levitation — ROOT CAUSE FOUND & FIXED** (device log round 1:
      every attach lands ~1 m up, `nodeDy≈97 fixMoved=0 groundIsMobsi=0`).
      ZS_POS is a skeleton-root point but `Interactive::attach` fed it to
      `Npc::setPosition`, which expects the FEET — upstream regression
      `ac2316d4` ("remove Npc::translateY") dropped the `y-npc.translateY()`
      conversion, and `a2318ba2` (fixNpcPosition early-out when no collision)
      removed the down-ray that used to mask it — a character floating 1 m up
      collides with nothing, so `fixMoved=0`. Not iOS-specific: the May-17
      Windows release (v0.92) has ac2316d4 but predates a2318ba2, hence "works
      on Windows". Fix: convert root→feet via `mv-(centerPosition()-position())`
      before `setPos` (pure-Y, preserves beds/ladders). **Upstream PR-ready.**
      Diagnostics kept for one confirmation round (`s0=`/`lay=` fields added).

Tracked work beyond the core "build + run + control" milestone.
Bug ids (B1–B9, N1–N5) refer to the code-review report; phases refer to the
"ideal gamepad" control spec.

## ✅ Done — fps unlock, HUD safe-area, ring icons, mobsi levitation (2026-07-12)
- [x] **ProMotion unlock** — `preferredFrameRateRange(30,120,120)` on the
      CADisplayLink (apply-patches.sh) + `CADisableMinimumFrameDurationOnPhone`
      in Info.plist. DEVICE-CONFIRMED: menu 60, in-game 40–45 (was hard 30).
- [x] **Triple buffering** — Tempest pins `maximumDrawableCount=2` on iOS
      (2 GB-iPhone memory guard); with `allowsNextDrawableTimeout=NO` the
      present path blocks in `nextDrawable()` up to a full vsync every frame.
      Patched 2→3 via apply-patches.sh (~15 MB extra); lifts the fixed
      per-frame stall on all displays, incl. non-ProMotion 60 Hz.
- [x] **HUD safe-area** — `utils/safearea.{h,cpp,mm}` reads
      `UIWindow.safeAreaInsets`×`contentScaleFactor`; cached per painted frame
      in `MainWindow::paintEvent` (ctor can run pre-layout, and a same-size
      relayout never reaches `resizeEvent` — Widget::resize early-outs).
      HP/mana/swim bars, fps counter, world clock and the pad-hint bar no
      longer fall under the rounded corners / Dynamic Island. 3D stays
      full-bleed.
- [x] **Quick-ring 3D item icons** (spec §4.5) — `QuickRing::paint` collects
      live icons into `InventoryMenu`'s `InventoryRenderer` (resolved by cls
      via one inventory-iterator pass; vanished items = empty tile). Renderer
      flush gate widened: items also draw when the ring collected them while
      the menu is closed (`Renderer::draw`), leftover icons cleared on ring
      close.
- [x] **Stick/pad X = turn** — physical left-stick X now turns proportionally
      while retaining `RotateL/RotateR` edges for classic combat, lockpicking
      and rotate+jump side-steps; the touch move-pad remains digital classic
      turning (`playercontrol.cpp:565`).
- [x] **Runes & scrolls in the magic quick-ring** — `ITM_CAT_RUNE` is the Magic
      ring filter; selecting a rune or scroll equips it.
- [x] **Mobsi levitation — round-2 diagnostics closed/superseded.** The added
      `[mobsi] attach:`/`[mobsi] quit:` data (`nodeDy≈97`, `fixMoved=0`) led to
      the root-vs-feet `Interactive::attach` fix documented above. Keep the logs
      for one final clean device round, then remove them via the backlog item.
- [x] **Mobsi levitation — candidate #1 closed (not the observed cause)** —
      a real bug in `GameScript::fixNpcPosition`: when the npc overlaps another NPC at the
      `ZS_POS` node, the ring-search down-ray (`+100cm → −1000cm`) can land on
      TOP of the interactive's collider (`DynamicWorld::ray` hits `C_Object`
      too) and the spot passes the npc-vs-npc-only `hasCollision()` check —
      the user then plays the use animation standing on the barrel/cupboard.
      Fixed: candidates whose ray hit an interactive (`ray.vob!=nullptr`) are
      rejected. Note: dt-spike hypothesis refuted — game logic dt is already
      clamped to 50 ms at the source (`MainWindow::tick`).

## ✅ Done — device-test round 1 fixes (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Save crash** — `MainWindow::saveGame` captured a GPU thumbnail
      (`screenshoot`+`submit`+`readPixels`) which aborts in the Metal driver on
      iOS. On iOS: skip that path, save a small placeholder preview + empty
      background; also guard the saving screen against an empty banner texture.
- [x] **Skip cutscenes** — output-only cutscene lines (`state==Idle`,
      `current.time>0`) ignored all input; `DialogMenu::keyDownEvent` now lets
      Esc/Return (touch Skip, pad B) call `skipPhrase` there too.
- [x] **Keep screen awake** — `application.idleTimerDisabled = YES` in
      `applicationDidBecomeActive` (via `apply-patches.sh`); the display no
      longer dims/locks mid-game when using a gamepad.
- [x] **Game Mode** — `GCSupportsGameMode` + `LSApplicationCategoryType =
      public.app-category.games` in `Info.plist` (lets iOS 18+ treat it as a game).
- [x] **FPS counter** — the existing overlay (drawn on mobile) is now toggled by
      `Gothic.ini [GAME] showFpsCounter=1` (read in `setupSettings`). NOTE: a
      literal checkbox inside the in-game options menu needs MENU.DAT (game-data)
      editing — not doable from engine code; the ini flag is the practical toggle.

## ✅ Done — critical bugfix cluster (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Dialogue voice-over** — root cause was iOS unconditionally skipping
      `Speech*.vdf` (OOM guard for iPhone 7). Now mounted on ≥4 GB devices,
      skipped only on <4 GB. ZenKit mmaps archives → low resident cost.
      (`resources.cpp`)
- [x] **B7** — split fatal exception handling: `GothicNotFoundException` shows the
      "data not found" alert + keeps a run-loop (safe, pre-window); any other
      exception logs + exits without spinning a second `Application` over a
      half-torn-down window. (`main.cpp`)
- [x] **B1** — Escape / Inventory now live on pad **and** touch: window-level
      `MainWindow::uiAction()` (shared with the keyboard path), called instead of
      the no-op `PlayerControl::onKeyPressed`. (`mainwindow.*`, `touchinput.cpp`)
- [x] **B2** — context-aware pad dispatcher (`PadCtx` + `padContext()` +
      `dispatchKey()`): pad drives menus / dialogue / inventory via synthetic
      key events, not just gameplay. (`gamepadinput.*`, `mainwindow.*`)
- [x] **B3** — gamepad quick save/load wired to `Gothic::quickSave/quickLoad`
      with the F5/F9 guards (LB+Menu / LB+View). (`gamepadinput.cpp`)
- [x] **B5** — controller disconnect, lifecycle reset, ring and UI transition
      release only world actions actually held by the pad, then require neutral
      re-arm. A generation epoch covers resets occurring between rendered frames
      and avoids release-side effects from inactive Heal/Potion actions.
- [x] **B6** — camera Y sign unified with the touch overlay; `invertY` field added.
- [x] Touch navigation for **inventory** — resolved by the same dispatcher.

## ✅ Done — iOS lifecycle & audio hardening (2026-07-10)
- [x] **B4** — `touchesCancelled` handled in Tempest `iosapi.mm` (forwards to
      `touchesEnded`); fixes stuck movement + leaked touch id on system touch
      cancel. Applied via `ios/patches/apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **B8** — `AVAudioSession` (Playback category, activated before any
      SoundDevice); linked `-framework AVFoundation`.
      (`game/utils/audiosession.{h,mm,cpp}`, `main.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`)
- [x] **N2** — `implDestroyWindow` invalidates `displayLink` + nulls `owner`
      (pairs with B7). Applied via `apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **N3** — fiber stack 1 MB → 8 MB (deep VM/vob recursion headroom).
      Applied via `apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **N5** — `Info.plist.in`: `UIRequiresFullScreen`, `ITSAppUsesNonExempt-
      Encryption=false`, `GCSupportsControllerUserInteraction`,
      `UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents`.

## ✅ Done — input coverage + landscape (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Touch dialogue controls** — the overlay is now context-aware
      (`MainWindow::padContext`): in dialogue it shows Up/Down (pick choice),
      Select (K_Return) and **Skip** (K_ESCAPE → `skipPhrase`), so lines can be
      skipped and choices confirmed from touch. (Pad already did this via B2.)
- [x] **Touch menu value editing** — menu/inventory overlay gained a full D-pad
      incl. **◀ ▶** (K_Left/K_Right), so sliders/options can be changed, plus
      OK/Back. Routed through `dispatchKey` to the active widget.
- [x] **Landscape orientation lock** — `Info.plist` landscape-only (iPhone+iPad)
      and both `supportedInterfaceOrientations` in `iosapi.mm` restricted to
      `MaskLandscape` (via `apply-patches.sh`); still rotates Left/Right.

## 🔥 In progress — save crash-to-home (round 3)
- Round 1 (`c0f30e50`, `d4de87ec`): removed GPU-thumbnail readback + fixed the
  `applicationSupportDirectory` MRC over-release. Save persists, crash remained.
- Round 2 (`56684300`): `catch(std::exception)` guards in `render()` +
  `implProcessEvents`. Crash remained, **no guard logged** → not a std::exception.
- Round 3 (`189145ae` + this): `catch(...)` guards + **exception identity
  logging** (`utils/exceptiondump.{h,mm,cpp}` — rethrows and names NSExceptions
  incl. throw-site backtrace); the loader-thread `noexcept` lambda now also has
  `catch(...)` (a foreign exception there aborted with no log at all);
  `implProcessEvents` guard additionally catches `NSException*` with
  name/reason; `terminateHandler` writes the NSException identity to crash.log.
- **Round 3 RESULT (device log, 2026-07-10): exception hypothesis REFUTED.**
  crash.log tag is `SIGABRT` (signal handler), not `std::terminate` → no
  exception ever unwound; none of the four guards logged. Disassembly of the
  shipped binary: `implProcessEvents+368` is the **return address of the final
  `swapContext()` call** (+48=objc_autoreleasePoolPush, +360=objc_autoreleasePoolPop,
  +364=bl swapContext) → the game fiber finished its dispatch cleanly (pool
  popped) and the abort happens **inside libobjc on the UIKit/apple-fiber side**;
  the frames below libobjc are stale fiber-stack remnants (manual setjmp/longjmp
  breaks the FP walk).
- Round 4 (`640f5d08`): recover the **real abort reason** — `CrashLog::dumpStack`
  dumps `__DATA,__crash_info` annotations; `[save]` breadcrumbs; stderr →
  `Documents/stderr.log`.
- **Round 4 RESULT (device, iOS 26.6 beta): SMOKING GUN.**
  `objc[2004]: Invalid or prematurely-freed autorelease pool 0x…` — and the
  `.ips` shows `AutoreleasePoolPage::badPop` called from
  `implProcessEvents` (main thread). Breadcrumbs: **three quick-saves in a row
  succeeded**, then a save-slot enumeration ran (7× "Unable to open file" =
  save/load menu opened), and the **4th save died mid-saving-screen** between
  "startSave dispatched" and worker completion. So: the ObjC autorelease-pool
  STACK (per-thread TLS, shared by both setjmp/longjmp fibers) gets desynced —
  the game-loop pool's page is invalidated by the time implProcessEvents pops it.
  Not an exception, not MRC in our .mm files — a fiber/pool architecture defect.
- Round 5 (this): **(a) mitigation** — new `apply-patches.sh` step
  `no-objc-pool`: implProcessEvents no longer pushes an ObjC pool on the game
  fiber (plain scope; game-dispatch autoreleases drain in UIKit's own
  per-runloop-cycle pools — bounded); **(b) probe** — `utils/poolprobe.{h,mm,cpp}`
  (`_objc_autoreleasePoolPrint`, weak import) dumps the pool stack to
  stderr.log at save-begin / saving frames / finalize, so if a desync survives
  the mitigation we see exactly whose pool breaks. If the crash stops but pool
  dumps look wrong, the deeper fix is rethinking the fiber loop (e.g. drain
  pools only on the UIKit side).

## ✅ Save crash — FIXED & DEVICE-CONFIRMED (2026-07-10, round 5)
- `no-objc-pool` patch confirmed on device: the crash scenario (multiple
  quick-saves + menu between them + menu save) no longer crashes.
- **Follow-up found via the same logs:** `RFile` on iOS resolved relative
  paths against the app **bundle**, while `WFile` writes to CWD (Documents) —
  so loading a save failed ("Unable to open file"), slots had no
  header/date/thumbnail, and Gothic.ini could not be read back. Fixed with the
  `cwd-first` patch in apply-patches.sh (try CWD, then bundle).
- **DEVICE-CONFIRMED (round 6):** slots show name/date/game-time, loading works
  from both the main menu and in-game menu, and Gothic.ini settings persist.
- Follow-ups done: saves now **auto-named** "&lt;world&gt; - day D, H:MM" (menu; no
  system keyboard on iOS) and "Quick - &lt;world&gt;, day D H:MM" (pad rotating);
  temporary `[save]` breadcrumbs + PoolProbe call-sites removed (probe util kept
  dormant in `utils/poolprobe.*`); README "saving is broken" note replaced with
  a thumbnail-only limitation.
- Still TODO: real save **thumbnail** on iOS (placeholder image is saved; the
  original GPU-readback abort may have been this very pool bug — worth
  re-testing the upstream screenshot path now).

## ⏳ To do — deferred (needs on-device iteration)
- [ ] **B9 / N1** — pause game tick (`onTimer`) + `displayLink` while
      backgrounded. Deferred: the manual setjmp/longjmp fiber loop in `implExec`
      means naively sleeping the main context starves the UIKit run loop; needs
      careful on-device testing. (Render is already gated on `isApplicationActive`.)

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, phase 3 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Target-lock via native focus** (spec §3) — R3 pins the current npc focus
      (`PlayerControl::toggleTargetLock`); `tickFocus` keeps it instead of
      re-finding by aim, and auto-releases when the target dies/leaves
      (`World::validateFocus` + `Npc::isDead`). A horizontal right-stick flick
      switches target
      (`focusLeft/focusRight` → `moveFocus`). Existing focus highlight shows it.
      Replaces the provisional R3→`LookBack`.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 1 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **[GAMEPAD] config** (spec §8) — `deadZone`, `releaseZone`,
      `crossAxisGuard`, `triggerThreshold`, `lookSensitivity`, `invertY`,
      `saveSlots` and optional transition-only `debugInput` diagnostics are read from
      `Gothic.ini [GAMEPAD]` in `GamepadInput::loadConfig`.
- [x] **Rotating quick-saves** (spec §6) — LB+Menu saves to `save_slot_1..N`
      (N=`saveSlots`), auto-named `Quick - <world>`; index persisted in
      `[GAMEPAD] padQuickSlot`. LB+View loads the last rotating slot.
- [x] **Controls-help overlay** (spec §5) — context-sensitive button hints,
      flashed for ~4 s on context change, gamepad-only. Text glyphs (no bundled
      assets). Target **lock-on reticle** (corner brackets) drawn on the pinned
      target. Touch overlay auto-hides when a gamepad is connected.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 2 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Radial rings** (spec §4) — RB opens the magic quick-bar (runes +
      scrolls), LT the item quick-bar (potions + food); hold to aim with the
      right stick, release to activate. Content is pulled live from inventory
      and rendered with 3D item icons. `QuickRing` is owned by `GamepadInput`
      and drawn by `MainWindow`.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 3 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Haptics** (spec §7) — `Haptics::impact` via `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`
      (haptics.mm/.cpp split like systemmsg). Heavy pulse when the player's HP
      drops (polled, no combat-code changes); light on lock/ring-commit; medium
      on quick-save.
- [x] **Stuck-protection** (spec §8) — hold L3+R3 ~2 s to warp to the nearest
      waypoint (`World::findWayPoint` + `Npc::setPosition`); opt out with
      `[GAMEPAD] noStuckProtect=1`.

## ✅ Done — controller glyphs (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Xelu CC0 glyphs** (Xbox Series set) bundled in `assets/controller/`,
      loaded from the app bundle (`padglyphtex.mm`, `Resources::loadTexturePm`)
      and drawn as real button art; falls back to the drawn glyphs
      (`padglyph.cpp`: A/B/X/Y discs, LB/RB/LT/RT pills, sticks, D-pad, Menu/View)
      if a texture is missing. Used by the touch overlay + controls-help bar.

## ✅ Done — full on-screen virtual gamepad (2026-07-10)
- [x] World touch overlay is now a **full virtual pad** (16 glyph buttons):
      A/B/X/Y, RB(magic ring)/RT(block)/LB(quick-save)/LT(item ring), L3(walk)/
      R3(lock), D-pad (melee/bow + assignable slots), View/Menu, plus move pad +
      camera.
      Each wired to its action via `ctrl`/`uiAction`/new `MainWindow::pad*`
      bridges. **Touch ring-selection**: tapping RB/LT opens the radial, drag aims
      it, release activates (`GamepadInput::ring*` hooks). Uses Xelu glyphs.
      NOTE: button placement/sizes are v1 — tune on device.

## ⏳ Spec gaps / simplifications (control spec §1–§8) — deliberate, not blocking
- [ ] Rings are **single-ring v1**: no concentric multi-ring + centre-easing
      (`SmoothIncrease`), no world-pause while open, no pulsing highlight
      (spec §4.3–§4.4). 3D item icons done (2026-07-12).
- [ ] Target-lock has no **camera auto-pull** toward the pinned target (spec §3).
- [ ] No dedicated **Dead**-screen / **Container**-vs-Inventory / **MapDoc**
      pad contexts (folded into Menu/Inventory) (spec §1.1).
- [ ] Inventory RB/LB **tab switching** + right-stick 3D item preview (spec §2.4).
- [ ] Overlay **daylight tint** (spec §5.5, optional).
- [ ] Deferred B9/N1 background pause (needs on-device fiber testing).

Otherwise §1–§8 implemented; remaining is polish / on-device tuning (ring feel,
haptic intensity, glyph sizing, hint wording).

## ✅ Done — UI / readability
- [x] Scale up UI on iOS for high-DPI legibility (`MainWindow::uiScale`).
- [x] Dialogue subtitle window enlarged / reflowed for phone screens.
- [x] Dialogue **choice** list enlarged and made touch-friendly.
- [x] Main-menu text size verified after the uiScale change.
- [x] Controller-layout labels wrap to at most two lines, use height-aware
      callout spacing, reserve the build-version line, and infer EN/DE/PL from
      the active `MENU.DAT` strings (including Polish data with `GAME.language=-1`).

## ⏳ To do — Language
- [ ] Polish requires Polish game data (e.g. GOG Gold Edition or a PL install);
      then automatic, or force via `[GAME] language=2` in Documents/Gothic.ini.
