# iOS port — status & backlog

Tracked work beyond the core "build + run + control" milestone.
Bug ids (B1–B9, N1–N5) refer to the code-review report; phases refer to the
"ideal gamepad" control spec.

## ✅ Done — device-test round 1 fixes (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Save crash** — `MainWindow::saveGame` captured a GPU thumbnail
      (`screenshoot`+`submit`+`readPixels`) which aborts in the Metal driver on
      iOS. On iOS: skip that path, save a small placeholder preview + empty
      background; also guard the saving screen against an empty banner texture.
- [x] **Skip cutscenes** — output-only cutscene lines (`state==Idle`,
      `current.time>0`) ignored all input; `DialogMenu::keyDownEvent` now lets
      Esc/Return (touch Skip, pad B) call `skipPhrase` there too.
- [x] **Keep screen awake** — `application.idleTimerDisabled = YES` in
      `applicationDidBecomeActive` (via `apply-patches.sh`); the display no
      longer dims/locks mid-game when using a gamepad.
- [x] **Game Mode** — `GCSupportsGameMode` + `LSApplicationCategoryType =
      public.app-category.games` in `Info.plist` (lets iOS 18+ treat it as a game).
- [x] **FPS counter** — the existing overlay (drawn on mobile) is now toggled by
      `Gothic.ini [GAME] showFpsCounter=1` (read in `setupSettings`). NOTE: a
      literal checkbox inside the in-game options menu needs MENU.DAT (game-data)
      editing — not doable from engine code; the ini flag is the practical toggle.

## ✅ Done — critical bugfix cluster (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Dialogue voice-over** — root cause was iOS unconditionally skipping
      `Speech*.vdf` (OOM guard for iPhone 7). Now mounted on ≥4 GB devices,
      skipped only on <4 GB. ZenKit mmaps archives → low resident cost.
      (`resources.cpp`)
- [x] **B7** — split fatal exception handling: `GothicNotFoundException` shows the
      "data not found" alert + keeps a run-loop (safe, pre-window); any other
      exception logs + exits without spinning a second `Application` over a
      half-torn-down window. (`main.cpp`)
- [x] **B1** — Escape / Inventory now live on pad **and** touch: window-level
      `MainWindow::uiAction()` (shared with the keyboard path), called instead of
      the no-op `PlayerControl::onKeyPressed`. (`mainwindow.*`, `touchinput.cpp`)
- [x] **B2** — context-aware pad dispatcher (`PadCtx` + `padContext()` +
      `dispatchKey()`): pad drives menus / dialogue / inventory via synthetic
      key events, not just gameplay. (`gamepadinput.*`, `mainwindow.*`)
- [x] **B3** — gamepad quick save/load wired to `Gothic::quickSave/quickLoad`
      with the F5/F9 guards (LB+Menu / LB+View). (`gamepadinput.cpp`)
- [x] **B5** — pad disconnect mid-hold releases all world actions (no stuck keys).
- [x] **B6** — camera Y sign unified with the touch overlay; `invertY` field added.
- [x] Touch navigation for **inventory** — resolved by the same dispatcher.

## ✅ Done — iOS lifecycle & audio hardening (2026-07-10)
- [x] **B4** — `touchesCancelled` handled in Tempest `iosapi.mm` (forwards to
      `touchesEnded`); fixes stuck movement + leaked touch id on system touch
      cancel. Applied via `ios/patches/apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **B8** — `AVAudioSession` (Playback category, activated before any
      SoundDevice); linked `-framework AVFoundation`.
      (`game/utils/audiosession.{h,mm,cpp}`, `main.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`)
- [x] **N2** — `implDestroyWindow` invalidates `displayLink` + nulls `owner`
      (pairs with B7). Applied via `apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **N3** — fiber stack 1 MB → 8 MB (deep VM/vob recursion headroom).
      Applied via `apply-patches.sh`.
- [x] **N5** — `Info.plist.in`: `UIRequiresFullScreen`, `ITSAppUsesNonExempt-
      Encryption=false`, `GCSupportsControllerUserInteraction`,
      `UIApplicationSupportsIndirectInputEvents`.

## ✅ Done — input coverage + landscape (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Touch dialogue controls** — the overlay is now context-aware
      (`MainWindow::padContext`): in dialogue it shows Up/Down (pick choice),
      Select (K_Return) and **Skip** (K_ESCAPE → `skipPhrase`), so lines can be
      skipped and choices confirmed from touch. (Pad already did this via B2.)
- [x] **Touch menu value editing** — menu/inventory overlay gained a full D-pad
      incl. **◀ ▶** (K_Left/K_Right), so sliders/options can be changed, plus
      OK/Back. Routed through `dispatchKey` to the active widget.
- [x] **Landscape orientation lock** — `Info.plist` landscape-only (iPhone+iPad)
      and both `supportedInterfaceOrientations` in `iosapi.mm` restricted to
      `MaskLandscape` (via `apply-patches.sh`); still rotates Left/Right.

## 🔥 In progress — save crash-to-home (round 3)
- Round 1 (`c0f30e50`, `d4de87ec`): removed GPU-thumbnail readback + fixed the
  `applicationSupportDirectory` MRC over-release. Save persists, crash remained.
- Round 2 (`56684300`): `catch(std::exception)` guards in `render()` +
  `implProcessEvents`. Crash remained, **no guard logged** → not a std::exception.
- Round 3 (`189145ae` + this): `catch(...)` guards + **exception identity
  logging** (`utils/exceptiondump.{h,mm,cpp}` — rethrows and names NSExceptions
  incl. throw-site backtrace); the loader-thread `noexcept` lambda now also has
  `catch(...)` (a foreign exception there aborted with no log at all);
  `implProcessEvents` guard additionally catches `NSException*` with
  name/reason; `terminateHandler` writes the NSException identity to crash.log.
- **Round 3 RESULT (device log, 2026-07-10): exception hypothesis REFUTED.**
  crash.log tag is `SIGABRT` (signal handler), not `std::terminate` → no
  exception ever unwound; none of the four guards logged. Disassembly of the
  shipped binary: `implProcessEvents+368` is the **return address of the final
  `swapContext()` call** (+48=objc_autoreleasePoolPush, +360=objc_autoreleasePoolPop,
  +364=bl swapContext) → the game fiber finished its dispatch cleanly (pool
  popped) and the abort happens **inside libobjc on the UIKit/apple-fiber side**;
  the frames below libobjc are stale fiber-stack remnants (manual setjmp/longjmp
  breaks the FP walk).
- Round 4 (`640f5d08`): recover the **real abort reason** — `CrashLog::dumpStack`
  dumps `__DATA,__crash_info` annotations; `[save]` breadcrumbs; stderr →
  `Documents/stderr.log`.
- **Round 4 RESULT (device, iOS 26.6 beta): SMOKING GUN.**
  `objc[2004]: Invalid or prematurely-freed autorelease pool 0x…` — and the
  `.ips` shows `AutoreleasePoolPage::badPop` called from
  `implProcessEvents` (main thread). Breadcrumbs: **three quick-saves in a row
  succeeded**, then a save-slot enumeration ran (7× "Unable to open file" =
  save/load menu opened), and the **4th save died mid-saving-screen** between
  "startSave dispatched" and worker completion. So: the ObjC autorelease-pool
  STACK (per-thread TLS, shared by both setjmp/longjmp fibers) gets desynced —
  the game-loop pool's page is invalidated by the time implProcessEvents pops it.
  Not an exception, not MRC in our .mm files — a fiber/pool architecture defect.
- Round 5 (this): **(a) mitigation** — new `apply-patches.sh` step
  `no-objc-pool`: implProcessEvents no longer pushes an ObjC pool on the game
  fiber (plain scope; game-dispatch autoreleases drain in UIKit's own
  per-runloop-cycle pools — bounded); **(b) probe** — `utils/poolprobe.{h,mm,cpp}`
  (`_objc_autoreleasePoolPrint`, weak import) dumps the pool stack to
  stderr.log at save-begin / saving frames / finalize, so if a desync survives
  the mitigation we see exactly whose pool breaks. If the crash stops but pool
  dumps look wrong, the deeper fix is rethinking the fiber loop (e.g. drain
  pools only on the UIKit side).

## ✅ Save crash — FIXED & DEVICE-CONFIRMED (2026-07-10, round 5)
- `no-objc-pool` patch confirmed on device: the crash scenario (multiple
  quick-saves + menu between them + menu save) no longer crashes.
- **Follow-up found via the same logs:** `RFile` on iOS resolved relative
  paths against the app **bundle**, while `WFile` writes to CWD (Documents) —
  so loading a save failed ("Unable to open file"), slots had no
  header/date/thumbnail, and Gothic.ini could not be read back. Fixed with the
  `cwd-first` patch in apply-patches.sh (try CWD, then bundle).
- **DEVICE-CONFIRMED (round 6):** slots show name/date/game-time, loading works
  from both the main menu and in-game menu, and Gothic.ini settings persist.
- Follow-ups done: saves now **auto-named** "&lt;world&gt; - day D, H:MM" (menu; no
  system keyboard on iOS) and "Quick - &lt;world&gt;, day D H:MM" (pad rotating);
  temporary `[save]` breadcrumbs + PoolProbe call-sites removed (probe util kept
  dormant in `utils/poolprobe.*`); README "saving is broken" note replaced with
  a thumbnail-only limitation.
- Still TODO: real save **thumbnail** on iOS (placeholder image is saved; the
  original GPU-readback abort may have been this very pool bug — worth
  re-testing the upstream screenshot path now).

## ⏳ To do — deferred (needs on-device iteration)
- [ ] **B9 / N1** — pause game tick (`onTimer`) + `displayLink` while
      backgrounded. Deferred: the manual setjmp/longjmp fiber loop in `implExec`
      means naively sleeping the main context starves the UIKit run loop; needs
      careful on-device testing. (Render is already gated on `isApplicationActive`.)

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, phase 3 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Target-lock via native focus** (spec §3) — R3 pins the current npc focus
      (`PlayerControl::toggleTargetLock`); `tickFocus` keeps it instead of
      re-finding by aim, and auto-releases when the target dies/leaves
      (`World::validateFocus` + `Npc::isDead`). D-pad ←/→ switch target
      (`focusLeft/focusRight` → `moveFocus`). Existing focus highlight shows it.
      Replaces the provisional R3→`LookBack`.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 1 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **[GAMEPAD] config** (spec §8) — `deadZone`, `triggerThreshold`,
      `lookSensitivity`, `invertY`, `saveSlots` read from `Gothic.ini [GAMEPAD]`
      in `GamepadInput::loadConfig`. Replaces the hard-coded tunables.
- [x] **Rotating quick-saves** (spec §6) — LB+Menu saves to `save_slot_1..N`
      (N=`saveSlots`), auto-named `Quick - <world>`; index persisted in
      `[GAMEPAD] padQuickSlot`. LB+View loads the last rotating slot.
- [x] **Controls-help overlay** (spec §5) — context-sensitive button hints,
      flashed for ~4 s on context change, gamepad-only. Text glyphs (no bundled
      assets). Target **lock-on reticle** (corner brackets) drawn on the pinned
      target. Touch overlay auto-hides when a gamepad is connected.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 2 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Radial rings** (spec §4) — RB opens the weapon quick-bar, LT the item
      quick-bar; hold to aim with the right stick, release to activate
      (`Npc::useItem` equips weapons / consumes items). Content pulled live from
      inventory (weapons = NF|FF, items = POTION|FOOD), own vector segments with
      text labels + equipped/selection markers. `QuickRing` owned by
      `GamepadInput`, drawn by `MainWindow`.

## ✅ Done — ideal controls, batch 3 (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Haptics** (spec §7) — `Haptics::impact` via `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator`
      (haptics.mm/.cpp split like systemmsg). Heavy pulse when the player's HP
      drops (polled, no combat-code changes); light on lock/ring-commit; medium
      on quick-save.
- [x] **Stuck-protection** (spec §8) — hold L3+R3 ~2 s to warp to the nearest
      waypoint (`World::findWayPoint` + `Npc::setPosition`); opt out with
      `[GAMEPAD] noStuckProtect=1`.

## ✅ Done — controller glyphs (2026-07-10)
- [x] **Xelu CC0 glyphs** (Xbox Series set) bundled in `assets/controller/`,
      loaded from the app bundle (`padglyphtex.mm`, `Resources::loadTexturePm`)
      and drawn as real button art; falls back to the drawn glyphs
      (`padglyph.cpp`: A/B/X/Y discs, LB/RB/LT/RT pills, sticks, D-pad, Menu/View)
      if a texture is missing. Used by the touch overlay + controls-help bar.

## ✅ Done — full on-screen virtual gamepad (2026-07-10)
- [x] World touch overlay is now a **full virtual pad** (16 glyph buttons):
      A/B/X/Y, RB(weapon ring)/RT(block)/LB(quick-save)/LT(item ring), L3(walk)/
      R3(lock), D-pad (Heal/Potion + focus L/R), View/Menu, plus move pad + camera.
      Each wired to its action via `ctrl`/`uiAction`/new `MainWindow::pad*`
      bridges. **Touch ring-selection**: tapping RB/LT opens the radial, drag aims
      it, release activates (`GamepadInput::ring*` hooks). Uses Xelu glyphs.
      NOTE: button placement/sizes are v1 — tune on device.

## ⏳ Spec gaps / simplifications (control spec §1–§8) — deliberate, not blocking
- [ ] Rings are **single-ring v1**: no concentric multi-ring + centre-easing
      (`SmoothIncrease`), no world-pause while open, no pulsing highlight, text
      labels instead of 3D item icons (spec §4.3–§4.5).
- [ ] Target-lock has no **camera auto-pull** toward the pinned target (spec §3).
- [ ] No dedicated **Dead**-screen / **Container**-vs-Inventory / **MapDoc**
      pad contexts (folded into Menu/Inventory) (spec §1.1).
- [ ] Inventory RB/LB **tab switching** + right-stick 3D item preview (spec §2.4).
- [ ] Overlay **daylight tint** (spec §5.5, optional).
- [ ] Deferred B9/N1 background pause (needs on-device fiber testing).

Otherwise §1–§8 implemented; remaining is polish / on-device tuning (ring feel,
haptic intensity, glyph sizing, hint wording).

## ✅ Done — UI / readability
- [x] Scale up UI on iOS for high-DPI legibility (`MainWindow::uiScale`).
- [x] Dialogue subtitle window enlarged / reflowed for phone screens.
- [x] Dialogue **choice** list enlarged and made touch-friendly.
- [x] Main-menu text size verified after the uiScale change.

## ⏳ To do — Language
- [ ] Polish requires Polish game data (e.g. GOG Gold Edition or a PL install);
      then automatic, or force via `[GAME] language=2` in Documents/Gothic.ini.
