# Controller and quick-ring architecture

This is the maintainer reference for the iOS controller implementation. User-facing
controls remain in [`README-ios.md`](README-ios.md); device verification details are
recorded here alongside the relevant implementation notes.

The original implementation was introduced by commit `60ce08a2` and validated
by GitHub Actions run `29211433774`. The RendererIOS candidate also includes
the reference port's safe-area overlay and continuous stick axes; its own
physical-device and visual acceptance are tracked in `RELEASE-CANDIDATE.md`.

## Input pipeline

1. The main thread initializes `Gamepad` before polling. `game/utils/gamepad.mm` reads `GCExtendedGamepad` on its private handler queue.
   It publishes the newest analog snapshot and queues lossless digital button edges.
2. `Gamepad::consume()` returns one `GamepadInputFrame`: the newest state, ordered
   digital transitions, controller generation and overflow count, without a synchronous
   refresh on the handler queue. UIApplication and UIScene events release or reconnect the pad.
3. `game/ui/gamepadinput.cpp` selects exactly one `PadCtx` (`World`, `Dialog`,
   `Menu`, `Inventory` or `Loading`) and routes the frame only to that context.
   A normal ring captures `World`; an assignment ring captures the still-open
   `Inventory` until RT assigns or B closes the editor.
4. World actions enter `PlayerControl`; UI contexts receive complete synthetic key
   taps through `MainWindow::dispatchKey`.

LT and RT are intentionally analog-only. They are evaluated against
`[GAMEPAD] triggerThreshold`; Apple `isPressed` callbacks are not queued because
their system-defined threshold could disagree with the configured value. The tradeoff
is that an exceptionally fast complete trigger press/release between two simulation
ticks can be missed. Normal digital buttons retain FIFO edges, including A/B in menus
and dialogue.

Controller generation changes, `PlayerControl::inputGeneration()`, UI transitions,
ring opening and disconnects release controller-owned state. Continuous inputs must
return to neutral before they can re-arm. This prevents an input held in a menu or
before app resume from leaking into gameplay.

## Final mapping

| Control | World action |
|---|---|
| A / Cross | Interact/use while unarmed; confirm in UI/rings |
| B / Circle | Melee special; Back in UI; cancel a ring |
| X / Square | Jump/climb |
| Y / Triangle | Draw/sheathe the last weapon |
| LT / L2 | Unarmed: draw bow; melee: block; bow/crossbow: aim |
| RT / R2 | Unarmed: draw melee; armed: attack/shoot/cast |
| LB / L1 | Melee: left attack; otherwise temporary walk; Journal/Statistics: previous page |
| RB / R1 | Melee: right attack; otherwise look back; Journal/Statistics: next page |
| L3 | Toggle sneak |
| R3 | World: toggle native target lock; Inventory: edit the highlighted item binding |
| D-pad Up | Open/switch to the Items ring |
| D-pad Down | Open/switch to the Weapons/Magic ring |
| D-pad Left | Quest journal, or previous target while locked |
| D-pad Right | Scripted Map, or next target while locked |
| View | Inventory |
| Menu | Game menu |
| L3 + R3 | Hold about 2 seconds: nearest-waypoint unstuck teleport |

Controller quick-save/load shortcuts and the first-person binding are deliberately
not assigned. Engine keyboard F5/F9 remains available when enabled.

## Journal and Statistics pages

`MENU_LOG` and `MENU_STATUS` remain separate script-defined menus for Gothic 1,
Gothic 2 and mod compatibility. `MenuRoot::isActive(Action)` identifies only the
root page (not a pushed child or an active quest dialog), and `MainWindow` cycles
between those two existing pages for LB/RB. No `MENU.DAT` layout is replaced.
The left stick is intentionally ignored throughout both character pages; their
navigation belongs exclusively to the D-pad.

Desktop keeps the original blocking Tempest dialogs for quest lists and text. On
mobile, opening `Dialog::exec()` from a synthetic touch/controller event would
stall the render loop, so `GameMenu` uses an equivalent non-blocking list/content
state instead. `GameMenu::onModalKeyboard()` gives that active state exclusive
ownership: D-pad Up/Down moves or scrolls, A enters the selected quest and B closes
exactly one level. Input must never fall through to the category menu underneath.

## Combat semantics

The mobile dispatcher does not synthesize the Gothic 1 or Gothic 2 keyboard presets.
It sends internal actions declared in `game/utils/keycodec.h`:

- `PadAttack` -> `ActForward`;
- `PadAim` -> `ActGeneric` for bow/crossbow;
- `PadAttackLeft` / `PadAttackRight` -> directional melee attacks;
- `Parade` -> `ActBack` for melee block;
- `PadSpecial` -> `ActMove` for the engine's moving-forward melee attack path.

`PlayerControl::rebuildPadCombatAction()` rebuilds `actrl` from all semantic buttons
still held. Priority is attack, special, left, right, block, aim. Releasing RT while LT
is still held therefore returns to aim instead of clearing combat input.

Contextual controls must never change meaning during one physical hold. If
`WeaponState` changes while LT/RT/LB/RB remains down, the dispatcher releases the old
semantic action and suppresses the new one until a real release. LT also latches an
explicit `Idle` meaning in Mage state, preventing a held no-op LT from drawing a bow
after magic is sheathed.

LB walk is not the existing toggle action. `PlayerControl::setGamepadWalk(bool)` adds
`WM_Walk` only for the duration of the hold, remembers whether the mode already
existed, and removes only the bit it owns.

## Two separate quick-rings

The rings are separate modal `QuickRing` instances, never one combined wheel.

### Items

- 13 fixed sectors: 9 outer, then 4 inner overflow sectors.
- With no custom layout, filled automatically from potions, food and torches in
  the live inventory.
- In the normal player inventory (never chest/trade/ransack), R3 copies the
  current automatic arrangement into a working layout and opens the ring.
  The right stick selects any occupied or empty sector; RT assigns the
  highlighted non-gold item, LT clears the selected binding, and B closes the
  editor without another operation. Successful LT clears are immediate and
  are not rolled back by a later B press.
- A class can occupy only one sector. Reassigning moves it. Consuming or losing
  the last instance leaves a persistent empty binding; reacquiring it restores
  the icon in the same sector.
- Activating a manually assigned class follows the normal inventory toggle:
  equipped weapons, runes, armour and accessories are unequipped, while other
  classes use the regular `Inventory::use` path. The burning hand torch keeps
  its dedicated stow-and-return behavior.
- The first successful RT/LT operation switches the save to a stable manual
  layout. Cancelling the first editor without changing anything preserves
  automatic mode, while intentionally clearing every sector remains manual.
- A burning hand torch is absent from the inventory iterator, so a display-only
  synthetic `ItLsTorch` cell is added. Committing it calls the normal inventory-use
  path and stows the real torch without losing an item.

### Weapons / Magic

- 10 fixed sectors.
- 2 inner sectors: currently equipped melee and ranged weapon.
- 8 outer sectors: all active spell-book slots 3 through 10, including runes/scrolls.
  Slot 3 must be included because it is the first slot chosen by automatic rune
  assignment in the inventory.
- Committing returns `WeaponMele`, `WeaponBow` or `WeaponMage3..10` to
  `PlayerControl`, preserving normal draw/sheathe animation queuing.

The right-stick angle selects a sector. Stick distance selects inner/outer row with a
dead zone and hysteresis (`0.28`, inner transition `0.62`, outer transition `0.72`).
A or RT commits; B cancels; D-pad Up/Down switches panels. Empty sectors remain
visible but commit nothing.

Touch uses the same two modal panels. While open, the full virtual-pad overlay is
hidden and only corner D-pad Up/Down and B controls remain. A drag elsewhere selects;
release commits. A touch ring is cancelled when the app leaves `PadCtx::World`, so it
cannot retain a synthetic item from an unloaded world.

Rendering is procedural in `game/ui/quickring.cpp`: subdivided triangle sectors,
dark translucent fill, amber border and gold selection. Live 3D icons are collected in
the inventory renderer and flushed after the Painter layer. The ring is painted by the
last `TouchInput` overlay widget so assignment mode remains above `InventoryMenu`; the
separate inventory number overlay is suppressed while any ring is open.

### Assignment persistence

`GameSession` owns a 13-entry `uint32_t` layout (`UINT32_MAX` means empty) and a
customized flag. It is stored per save in the optional, self-versioned ZIP entry
`game/quickitems`. Old saves have no entry and remain automatic. Class IDs match the
symbol indices already serialized for normal items. Unknown or damaged optional data
is ignored without invalidating the rest of the save, and no global save-version bump
is required because older builds ignore additional ZIP entries.

## Inventory category navigation

The original `InventoryMenu` had no controller category command. The fork adds
`InventoryMenu::moveCategory(int direction)`:

- LB selects the first item of the previous category;
- RB selects the first item of the next category;
- selection wraps at both ends;
- categories come from the already sorted page and each item's `mainFlag`;
- existing selection, scrolling and `INV_CHANGE` sound paths are reused.

This does not create new tabs and does not change item sorting. It works on the active
inventory/container page. The touch inventory exposes matching LB/RB glyphs.

## Configuration

The stable `[GAMEPAD]` settings are:

```ini
[GAMEPAD]
analogDeadZone=0.10
analogEngageZone=0.18
deadZone=0.25
releaseZone=0.15
crossAxisGuard=0.12
triggerThreshold=0.50
lookSensitivity=0.20
invertY=0
```

Optional recovery setting:

```ini
[GAMEPAD]
noStuckProtect=1
```

The temporary `debugInput` transition trace was retired after device validation;
controller faults now use normal error reporting instead of per-input logging.

Normal movement and camera use radial `analogDeadZone`; the left stick engages at
`analogEngageZone` and releases at the lower dead zone. `PlayerControl` consumes the
continuous axes once per simulation tick. Settings changes release held inputs before
loading the new values.

Keep `releaseZone < deadZone` for discrete interactions (MOBSI, ladders and lockpicking).
Only that adapter uses `crossAxisGuard` to raise the perpendicular activation threshold.
The touch camera and physical right stick share the same camera/player rotation path.

## Device verification checklist

- Test both Gothic 1 and Gothic 2 control presets with melee, bow/crossbow and magic.
- Hold each contextual shoulder/trigger while drawing and sheathing weapons; no held
  input may silently become a different action.
- Confirm short A/B presses in dialogue, pause menu and inventory.
- In normal inventory, assign an automatic and a non-consumable item with R3 →
  right stick → RT; move an existing binding, clear several sectors with LT,
  cancel with B, save/load, consume/reacquire the last instance, and confirm
  chest/trade/ransack cannot enter assignment mode.
- Open assignment while LT/RT is already held, cross both triggers together,
  disconnect the pad, and start loading; no carried trigger may mutate a slot.
- Verify both ring sizes, inner/outer hysteresis, empty sectors, spells 3-10 and the
  last burning-torch stow case.
- Verify touch panel switching/cancel, and opening a menu/loading transition with a
  touch ring active.
- Test LB/RB category wrap on player inventory, chest and trade pages.
- Test View and Menu single-press actions, right-stick vertical look, `invertY=1`, left-stick
  cross-axis guard, disconnect/reconnect and app background/resume.
- Open every Journal category; verify D-pad navigation, A entering category/quest,
  B returning one level, and LB/RB switching Journal/Statistics only at the root.
  Repeat with both a physical controller and the on-screen LB/RB controls.

Update this file whenever controller semantics, ring geometry or input ownership
changes; update both user-facing diagrams in the same commit.
